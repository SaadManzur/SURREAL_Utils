in each npz we have keys
video_2d   N_video * 100 * 24*2
video_3d   N_video * 100 * 24*3
frame_num  100 is the longerest sequence length, frame_num records actual length of each sequence
width
height

# files description
03_01_c0008, the first val sequence images
smpl_relations.py from author of Surreal to give each joint name.
three surreal npz files, you can use any or all of them for training
Surreal comes from CMU-mocap, which is one of the world largest mocap sequences.
You can add gaussian noise to perturb the 2d joint to synthesis 2d detection instead of 2d gt.
